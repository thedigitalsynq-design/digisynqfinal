The post-streaming CapEx hangover, rising interest rates, and soaring insurance rates have rendered the legacy studio model economically untenable. Historically, production houses and studios accumulated tens of millions of dollars in physical balance-sheet assets—sound stages, virtual production LED volumes, anamorphic lens packages, and heavy camera trucks. However, the operational calendar of cinema is inherently episodic. These multi-million-dollar physical assets sit idle for 42% to 58% of the operational year, generating massive balance sheet depreciation, debt service drag, and unrecoverable carrying costs.',
